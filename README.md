ASP.Net Core CRUD application with MVC. 

User can view a list of popular movies which includes details such as the director, release date and an image of the movie poster.
Users can add their own movies to the list which is linked to an SQL Server database.

The purpose of this project was to showcase my ability to create a MVC CRUD application, link it to a database and allow users
to create, read from, update or delete entries on the list, which also includes image upload.
